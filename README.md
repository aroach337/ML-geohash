# ML-geohash
A demo app showing off MarkLogic's new geohash functions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to a local directory.
2. Set up an HTTP App Server in MarkLogic. Set the root to the directory from step 1, and set the port to whatever port number you would like (say, 1337). (See https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/getting-started/xquery#id_15787 for detailed instructions.)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:1337/geohash.html (substituting your hostname and port number).
4. Draw some polygons, and see their geohashes! Refresh to clear.

## Etc.
